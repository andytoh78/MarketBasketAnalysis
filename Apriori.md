| **Method**          | Apriori algorithm identifies frequent itemsets in a dataset and then extends them to larger itemsets as long as they appear sufficiently frequently in the database. explores the itemset space in a breadth-first manner, meaning that it first identifies frequent itemsets of size 1, then uses these frequent itemsets to generate candidate itemsets of size 2, and so on. It progressively increases the size of itemsets and checks their support.<br><br>It also operates on the principle that a subset of a frequent itemset (based on a user defined minimum support threshold) must also be frequent. Assume itemset {A, B, C} is frequent. According to the subset principle, it implies that {A, B}, {A, C}, {B, C}, {A}, {B}, and {C} must also be frequent. This is because any transaction that contains {A, B, C} also implicitly contains all the subsets. This principle efficiently reduces the number of support calculations needed and speeds up the discovery of association rules in large transactional datasets. |
| **Key Parameters**  | `min_support` : User-defined threshold (decimal between 0 and 1) that determines the minimum frequency at which an itemset must be present in the dataset to be considered 'frequent'.<br><br>`confidence_threshold` : User-defined minimum level of confidence that an association rule must exceed to be considered significant.<br><br>`lift_threshold` : User-defined minimum lift value (typically >1 to focus on rules that having positive relationship between the antecedent and consequent) that an association rule must have to be considered interesting or useful
| **Pros**            | Simple to understand and easy to implement. Effective for small to medium-sized datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Cons**            | Can be inefficient for large datasets due to multiple scans of the database and the generation of numerous candidate sets.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Additional Info** | Often used as a benchmark for comparing performance of other association rule learning algorithms.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Steps**           | 1 - Load the data and preprocess it so that each transaction is represented by a list of item. This involves transforming the dataset into a one-hot encoded DataFrame where each item in the dataset is represented by a column, and each row corresponds to a transaction with boolean values (0 - Not in Transaction, 1 - In Transaction).<br><br>2. Install mlxtend library<br><br>`pip install mlxtend`<br><br>3 - Utilize the `apriori` function from the `mlxtend.frequent_patterns` module to find frequent itemsets. Set the `min_support` parameter.<br><br>`from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules`<br>`min_support_threshold = 0.1`<br>`frequent_itemsets = apriori(df, min_support=min_support_threshold, use_colnames=True)`<br><br>4 - Generate the association rules from the frequent itemsets using the `association_rules` function from the `mlxtend.frequent_patterns` module. Choose a metric like 'confidence' or 'lift' and set a minimum threshold to filter the most significant rules.<br><br>`confidence_threshold = 0.4`<br>`rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="confidence", min_threshold=confidence_threshold)`<br><br>5 - Filter and sort the rules based on confidence, lift, and leverage to find the most relevant rules for business strategies.<br><br>`sorted_rules = rules.sort_values(['confidence', 'support', 'lift'], ascending=[False, False, False])`
