This data typically includes key details such as the items purchased in each transaction, the time and date of purchase, and other relevant customer and transaction information. The richness and accuracy of this data are crucial, as they form the basis for all subsequent analysis and insights.|\n| **Preprocess Data** | Data cleaning and preprocessing are critical steps to ensure the quality and usability of the transaction data. This phase involves removing irrelevant information that does not contribute to the analysis, such as extraneous details or erroneous entries, handling missing values, and converting/ restructuring the data into a consistent format that is compatible with the Algorithm.|\n| **Use Association Rule Mining Algorithms** | Applying data mining algorithms, like Apriori or FP-Growth, to identify patterns within the data. These algorithms are designed to uncover frequent itemsets, which are groups of items that commonly appear together in transactions. These itemsets form the basis for deriving meaningful insights about customer purchasing patterns.|\n| **Calculate Support and Confidence** | Two key metrics are calculated in this step: support and confidence.<br>- Support refers to the frequency of occurrence of an itemset within the dataset, indicating how common or popular a combination of items is<br>- Confidence measures the conditional probability that a specific item is purchased when another item or set of items is bought|\n| **Generate Association Rules** | Based on the frequent itemsets and their corresponding support and confidence values, association rules are generated. These rules are logical statements that express the likelihood of items being purchased together. They are fundamental in understanding and leveraging the relationships unearthed in the data.|\n| **Interpret Results** | Analyzing the patterns and associations identified by the Market Basket Analysis. This step is crucial for gaining insights into customer behavior and preferences. By understanding these patterns, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of how different products are interconnected in the eyes of the customers.|\n| **Inform Business Decisions** | The final step is applying the insights derived from the Market Basket Analysis to inform and enhance business decisions. This can include using the findings for product recommendations, optimizing the store layout based on commonly purchased items, and developing targeted marketing campaigns. These actions can lead to increased sales, improved customer satisfaction, and more efficient store management.|\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Association Rule Learning**\n---\n\nAssociation rule learning is a technique in data mining for discovering interesting relationships between variables in large datasets. The primary goal is to find frequent patterns, correlations, or associations from data sets found in various kinds of databases such as relational databases, transactional databases, and other forms of repositories. For instance, have you ever considered the [possibility of a connection between the purchase of diapers and beer](https://tdwi.org/articles/2016/11/15/beer-and-diapers-impossible-correlation.aspx)?\n\nAn association rule has two parts: **antecedent (IF)** and **consequent (THEN)**. The rule suggests that if the antecedent happens, the consequent is likely to occur as well. These rules are typically used to analyze retail basket or transaction data, but are also applicable in other areas like web usage mining, intrusion detection, and bioinformatics.\n\nAssociation rules can be classified into 3 broad categories and the strength can be measured in terms of its **support** and **confidence**.\n- **Trival** (everyone knows about it!) \n- **Inexplicable** (does not make any logical sense but seems to correlated)\n- **Actionable** (insights that suggest a course of action) \n\n&nbsp;\n\n## **Support**\n---\nSupport (Coverage) refers to the **frequency** with which **an itemset appears in the dataset**. Ranged **between 0 and 1**, it provides an indication of how common or popular an itemset is within the given dataset, with **0 being the least common** (indicating that the itemset does not appear in any transactions) and **1 being the most common** (indicating that the itemset appears in all transactions). An itemset in the context of association rule learning is a set of one or more items that occur together in a transactional dataset.\n\nAn itemset is considered **frequent** only if the support is equal or greater than an agreed upon (user-defined) minimal value, also known as **minimum support threshold**. This principle assumes that not all item combinations are equally significant or interesting; some occur together more often than others. By focusing only the frequent itemsets, we aim to uncover the most relevant and potentially insightful patterns within the dataset.<br><br>\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n\\textsf{Support}(X)=\\dfrac{\\textsf{Total number of transactions containing } X}{\\textsf{Total number of transactions}}\n\\end{equation}$$\n\n\n<br>For an association rule $X$ (antecedent) â‡’ $Y$ (consequent), the support is the proportion of transactions in the dataset that contain both $X$ and $Y$.<br><br>\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n\\textsf{Support}(X \\cup Y)=\\dfrac{\\textsf{Total number of transactions containing } X\\textsf{ and } Y}{\\textsf{Total number of transactions}}=\\dfrac{(X \\cup Y)}{N}\n\\end{equation}$$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Consider the following transaction dataset (df), where each row represents a basket or transaction with a unique Transaction ID (TID), and each column represents a unique item.

Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994, is a classic algorithm in data mining used for mining frequent itemsets and discovering association rules in a database. This page aims to provide an overview of the Apriori algorithm, its method, key parameters, advantages, limitations, and a basic implementation guide using Python.\n\nThe Apriori algorithm operates by identifying frequent itemsets in a dataset and then extending them to larger itemsets, provided they appear sufficiently frequently in the database. It explores the itemset space in a breadth-first manner. Initially, it identifies frequent itemsets of size 1, then uses these to generate candidate itemsets of size 2, and so on, progressively increasing the size of itemsets and checking their support.\n\nA key principle of Apriori is that **a subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent**. For instance, if the itemset {A, B, C} is frequent, it implies that all of its subsets, such as {A, B}, {A, C}, {B, C}, {A}, {B}, and {C}, must also be frequent. This is because any transaction containing {A, B, C} also contains all its subsets. This principle efficiently reduces the number of support calculations needed and speeds up the discovery of association rules in large datasets.\n\n### **Key Parameters**\n| **Parameter**             | **Description**                                                               |\n|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `min_support`             | This is the user-defined threshold (a decimal between 0 and 1) that determines the minimum frequency at which an itemset must be present in the dataset to be considered 'frequent'.|\n| `confidence_threshold`    | This is the user-defined minimum level of confidence that an association rule must exceed to be considered significant.\n| `lift_threshold`          | This is the user-defined minimum lift value (typically >1) focusing on rules that have a positive relationship between the antecedent and consequent.|\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install machine learning extensions (mlxtend) library\n# !pip install mlxtend","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.786925Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.787424Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.800769Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.787342Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.799774Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load dataset and view first 5 rows\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning, module=\"seaborn\")\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=Warning)\npd.set_option(\"display.max_columns\", None)\npd.set_option(\"display.max_colwidth\", None)\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/market-basket-optimisation/Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv\", header=None, index_col=None, names=[f\"Item_{i}\" for i in range(1, 21)])\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.80252Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.802898Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.864767Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.802862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.863552Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# View shape of the dataset\nprint(f\"The dataset contains {df.shape[0]} transactions and each transaction has a maximum of {df.shape[1]} items or less.\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.866014Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.866356Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.872291Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.866326Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.871035Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Generate transaction lists\ntxns = df.fillna(\"\").values.tolist()\ntxns = [[item for item in txn if item != ''] for txn in txns]\ntxns = [[item.strip() for item in txn] for txn in txns]\n\n# Create a list of unique ids for the transactions\nids = [i + 1 for i in range(len(txns))]\n\n# Initialize an empty list\ndata =[]\n# Iterate through transactions and add them to the DataFrame with IDs\nfor i, txn in enumerate(txns):\n    data.extend([{'TID': ids[i], 'Item': item} for item in txn])\n\ndf_txn = pd.DataFrame(data)\ndf_txn.head(25)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.873975Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.874422Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.995467Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.874372Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.994173Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Perform one hot encoding using TransactionEncoder\nfrom mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder\n\n# Create a TransactionEncoder\nte = TransactionEncoder()\n\n# Fit and transform the transaction data\nte_array = te.fit(txns).transform(txns)\n\n# Extract the column names\nte_columns = te.columns_\n\n# Create a DataFrame from the one-hot encoded array\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(te_array, columns=te.columns_)\n\n# Display the results\ndf1.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.997198Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.997647Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-22T16:04:20.69244Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-22T16:04:19.997611Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-22T16:04:20.691221Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The output of the above code snippet provides a binary representation of the transaction data.

It differs from the Apriori algorithm in terms of its methodology and efficiency. This page aims to provide an overview of the Eclat algorithm, its method, key parameters, advantages, limitations, and a basic implementation guide using Python.\n\nThe Eclat algorithm employs a depth-first search strategy to find frequent itemsets in a dataset. Instead of generating candidate itemsets as in Apriori, Eclat uses a **vertical data format to represent transactions**. It maintains an index structure, often called the **tidset**, which records the transactions in which each item appears. Eclat then recursively combines frequent itemsets by **intersecting their tidsets**. This approach scans the database only once, eliminates the need for candidate generation, making it efficient for mining frequent itemsets in large databases.\n\n### **Key Parameters**\n| **Parameter**             | **Description**                                                               |\n|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `min_support`             | User-defined threshold (a decimal between 0 and 1) that determines the minimum frequency at which an itemset must be present in the dataset to be considered 'frequent'.|\n| `min_combination`    | User-defined minimum size of the itemsets to be considered frequent.<br><br>Setting a higher value for `min_combination` will result in the algorithm only considering larger itemsets as frequent.

This can lead to a larger number of discovered itemsets, including more specific and potentially noise patterns. It may be useful for finding fine-grained associations but can also result in a higher volume of results to analyze.|\n| `max_combination`          | User-defined maximum size of the itemsets to be considered.<br><br>Setting a higher value for `max_combination` allows the algorithm to consider larger itemsets as frequent.

However, it may also increase computational complexity and runtime.<br><br>Setting a lower value for `max_combination` limits the size of itemsets considered by the algorithm. It can lead to faster execution and a smaller number of results, focusing on more concise patterns.

**FP-Growth Algorithm**\n---\nThe FP-growth (Frequent Pattern growth) algorithm is another popular algorithm for discovering frequent itemsets and association rules. It offers advantages over both Apriori and Eclat in terms of efficiency and scalability. This page aims to provide an overview of the FP-growth algorithm, its method, key parameters, advantages, limitations, and a basic implementation guide using Python.\n\n\nThe FP-growth algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to discover frequent itemsets. It constructs a tree-like data structure known as the **FP-tree (Frequent Pattern tree)** from the transaction database. This tree structure compactly represents the frequent patterns and their support counts. FP-growth then **recursively mines the tree to find frequent itemsets**. Unlike Apriori, FP-growth does not generate candidate itemsets explicitly, which makes it faster and more memory-efficient, especially for large datasets. In addition, there is also a **header table**, alongside the FP-tree that stores pointers to the first occurrence of each item in the FP-tree. This speeds up the process of finding frequent itemsets.\n\n### **Key Parameters**\n| **Parameter**             | **Description**                                                               |\n|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `min_support`             | This is the user-defined threshold (a decimal between 0 and 1) that determines the minimum frequency at which an itemset must be present in the dataset to be considered 'frequent'.|\n| `confidence_threshold`    | This is the user-defined minimum level of confidence that an association rule must exceed to be considered significant.\n| `lift_threshold`          | This is the user-defined minimum lift value (typically >1) focusing on rules that have a positive relationship between the antecedent and consequent.|\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install machine learning extensions (mlxtend) library\n# !pip install

Algorithms**\n---\n- Mineral Water is frequently purchased in combination with a variety of other products, indicating its staple status in consumer transactions.<br>\n- A strong association between ground beef and spaghetti is consistently observed, particularly highlighted in the Apriori and FP-Growth results with a confidence level of approximately 39.89%.<br>\n- The tendency of customers purchasing soup along with mineral water is among the top rules in both Apriori and FP-Growth analyses, showing a confidence level of around 45.66%.<br>\n- All three algorithms show a high degree of consistency in identifying key item associations and trends, particularly concerning the prominence of mineral water and the frequent pairing of The consistency in these results enhances the reliability of the findings and provides a solid foundation for applying these insights in practical retail and marketing scenarios.","metadata":{}}]}
